    question: "How does the instant quote system work?",
    answer: "Customers fill out a simple form on your website with service details. Our AI calculates pricing based on your rates and sends them an instant quote via email. You get notified immediately and can follow up while the lead is hot.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the AI receptionist handle complex calls?",
    answer: "Yes. Our AI is trained specifically for home service businesses. It can answer questions about your services, provide estimates, schedule appointments, and handle objections. When something requires a human touch, it seamlessly transfers to your team with full context.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not tech-savvy?",
    answer: "No worries at all. We handle the entire setup, integration with your existing website, and provide training. You'll get a simple dashboard to see leads and appointments. Our team is available to help whenever you need it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can I get started?",
    answer: "Most businesses are live within 1-2 weeks. The quote system can be up in days. AI receptionist takes a bit longer as we train it on your specific services, pricing, and procedures to ensure quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it cost?",
    answer: "Pricing depends on your call volume and which tools you need. Most home service businesses invest $297-$997/month. Schedule a free quote call and we'll give you exact pricing based on your needs. No surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will customers know they're talking to an AI?",
    answer: "The AI sounds remarkably human and most customers don't notice. However, we believe in transparency. The AI can identify itself if asked directly. What customers really care about is getting help fast—and our AI delivers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the AI for my business?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We train the AI on your services, pricing, service areas, and brand voice. You can specify how it handles different scenarios, what questions it asks, and when to transfer to a human.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the AI makes a mistake?",
    answer: "We monitor conversations and continuously improve. If a call goes sideways, you get an alert and can step in. The AI also knows its limits—when unsure, it gracefully hands off to your team rather than guessing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to change my website?",
    answer: "Nope. Our tools integrate with any website. We add a chat widget, quote form, or phone system that works alongside your existing site. No redesign needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a contract or commitment?",
    answer: "We offer month-to-month plans with no long-term contracts. We're confident you'll stay because of the results, not because you're locked in. Most clients see ROI in the first 30 days.",
